    <p><em> A creamy tomato sauce exploding with flavour!</em> </p>
   
<p> <h3> <strong> Ingredients</strong></h3>
 
<ul>
   <li> 8 ounces uncooked pasta</li> 
   <li> 2 tablespoon Butter</li> 
   <li> 3/4 Cups Heavy/Whipping Cream (can use milk as a subtitute)</li> 
   <li> 2-3 cloves Garlic Minced</li> 
   <li> 1/2 Teaspoon Italian Seasoning</li> 
   <li> Salt & pepper to taste</li> 
   <li> 1 (14 ounce) can tomato sauce</li> 
   <li> 2 tablespoons tomato paste</li> 
   <li> Freshly grated parmesan cheese for serving, to taste (or any other cheese you have) </li> 
</ul></p>

<p> <h3> <strong> Instructions</strong></h3>
 
<ol>
<li> Boil a large, salted pot of water for your pasta and cook it al dente according to package instructions.</li>
<li> Meanwhile (once the pasta starts to cook), add the butter to a skillet over medium-high heat. Once it melts, add the garlic and saut√© for about a minute, stirring constantly.</li>
<li> Add in the tomato paste, tomato sauce, cream, and Italian seasoning. Stir until it's nice and smooth. Let the sauce cook for about 5 minutes or until it's thickened to your liking (it should be very gently bubbling, so you may need to turn down the heat).</li>
<li> Season the sauce with salt & pepper as needed (Be generous with both). If the sauce is a little too acidic/tangy for your liking, add in a pinch of sugar.</li>
<li> Drain the pasta and toss with the sauce (add a splash of hot pasta water if the sauce gets too thick).</li>
<li> Serve immediately with plenty of parmesan cheese over top.</li>

</ol>
